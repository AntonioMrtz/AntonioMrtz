# üí´ About Me:
### Hi there, I'm Antonio Mart√≠nez - Full Stack Software Engineer üëã

üö∂üèª I am a full-stack Software Engineer with a degree in Computer Science from the Universidad de Murcia. As an outgoing and proactive individual, I excel at tackling challenges, collaborating with diverse teams, and continuously refining processes to deliver innovative and impactful solutions. My strong verbal communication skills allow me to effectively present ideas and lead discussions. My adaptability to change, ability to self-manage, and commitment to independent learning have been key drivers of my professional growth.

üíª I‚Äôm deeply passionate about technology, eager to explore how things work, and always up for exciting projects. I created [Spotify Electron](https://github.com/AntonioMrtz/SpotifyElectron), an open-source, cross-platform desktop music streaming application that extends original Spotify features while introducing user-requested functionalities, such as the ability to upload personal songs. This project reflects my dedication to the full software development lifecycle, from agile planning to automation. I actively engage with a global network of contributors, ensuring high-quality code and fostering collaboration.


‚≠ê Right now, I‚Äôm working at [Bionet](https://bionet.com/) as a full-stack developer with Python and Angular. I am developing embedded backend software ([ROSITA2](https://bionet.com/software/rosita/)) for bioreactors, as well as the interface used to control the bioreactors. The main tasks I have carried out include implementing REST APIs and microservices using Python and FastAPI, along with designing and implemeting the touchscreen interface that allows users to manage the devices with Angular and Bootstrap. I‚Äôm responsible for software development in bSmart devices, such as [CT1](https://bionet.com/bioreactors/ct-1/) and [bBreath4](https://bionet.com/bioreactor-modules/bbreath/), collaborating closely with the electronics teams


üåü Beyond Full Stack development, I‚Äôm eager and excited to explore electronics and emerging technologies. As a dedicated Linux OS enthusiast, I have been using Linux exclusively for several years. I stay consistently up to date with the latest advancements in Linux-related technologies, with a particular focus on Ubuntu and Fedora. This deep engagement has not only strengthened my adaptability to evolving technologies but also enriched my expertise in operating systems.


ü•ä Outside of coding, I love outdoor sports like trail running and cycling, often participating in competitions. Music is another big part of my life‚ÄîI‚Äôm always keen to discover new genres and explore fresh artists.

By combining my passion for technology, adaptability, strong communication, and teamwork, I aim to contribute meaningfully to projects that drive innovation and success.
