# Hi there, I'm Antonio Martínez - Full-Stack Software Engineer 👋

🔝 I stand out in creating integrated frontend-backend solutions, designing software architecture and staying up to date with the latest tech trends. I enjoy tackling challenging problems and collaborating with diverse teams to transform ideas into software that drives impact.

💻 I’m deeply passionate about technology, eager to explore how things work, and always up for exciting projects. I created [Spotify Electron](https://github.com/AntonioMrtz/SpotifyElectron), an open-source, cross-platform desktop music streaming application that extends original Spotify features while introducing user-requested functionalities, such as the ability to upload personal songs. This project reflects my dedication to the full software development lifecycle, from agile planning to automation.

🌟 Beyond Full-Stack development, I’m eager and excited to explore electronics and emerging technologies. As a dedicated Linux OS enthusiast, I have been using Linux exclusively for several years.

🥊 Outside of coding, I love outdoor sports like trail running and cycling, often participating in competitions. Music is another big part of my life—I’m always keen to discover new genres and explore fresh artists.
